This will not only help us reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, but also secure our energy prices. Our sustainability work was recognised by, among others, the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the 11th consecutive year. As one of only 12 global retail companies in the index, we are assessed as a leader in environmental, social and governance performance. Investments in sustainability provide the group with long-term business opportunities. By building strategic partnerships with key stakeholders and growing in various innovative ways such as circular business models, we can grow our business in a way that decouples our financial growth and profitability from the use of finite natural resources. A good example of this is majority-owned fast-growing Sellpy, which is already one of the biggest players in second-hand fashion in Europe. Our investment arm CO:LAB is a way for us to explore new business models, and in addition to Sellpy we have invested in startups such as Smartex, Renewcell and Colorifix, to mention just a few. Our investments have in a short time created significant value, for example by improving the customer experience and enabling scaling and commercialisation of recycled and more sustainably sourced materials.\\xa0We will continue to make investments in new business models, materials and technologies that have the potential to drive radical shifts in how we make and remake our products, and how our customers can experience fashion. Alongside these efforts, we will keep working for increased levels of transparency to empower customers to make more informed decisions about the products they buy.OutlookLooking ahead, our main focus is on continuing to invest in and develop our customer offering and shopping experience for our unique brands, so that we keep meeting and exceeding our customers’ needs and expectations. Despite the turbulent world around us, H&M Group stands strong with a wide customer base, a robust financial position, healthy cash flow and a well-balanced inventory. Sales in 2023 have started well, showing that we can grow even in troubled times and when customers’ purchasing power is diminishing. We expect the external factors that have negatively affected our purchasing costs to gradually reverse and become positive in the second half of 2023. Our financial strength and long-term approach enable us to continue investing, and we are increasing capex from SEK 7 billion in 2022 to SEK 10 billion in 2023. All factors combined, there are very good prerequisites for 2023 to be a year of increased sales and improved profitability. Thus, our goal of achieving a double-digit operating margin for full-year 2024 remains in place. We see great potential for future expansion — despite our size, we can still grow and prosper further in new and existing markets. This is all thanks to the commitment from colleagues all around the world, who continue to build our company, stand true to our values and ensure we always realise the business idea that our founder laid the ground for 75 years ago — to deliver our customers unbeatable value with the best combination of fashion, quality, price and sustainability.
